## Practicing SQL using weekly Preppin' Data Challenges 

Preppin' Data is a weekly challenge created by Carl Allchin, Jenny Martin, et al.,  to help data enthusiast learn to prepare data and use Tableau prep. The data input and the expected data output can be downloaded from the [website](https://preppindata.blogspot.com). They are therefore very good resources to practice data transformation with different tools like Python or SQL.

In this repo, I share my Snowflake SQL script that I wrote to solve each weekly challenge. At the beginning of each script there are comments on the approach used to solve the task or the functions used to accomplish a particular part of the task. 

The upcoming challenge will be uploaded as soon as I complete it. If you found a error or have a question, feel free to reach out to me.
